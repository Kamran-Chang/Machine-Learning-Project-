Group Members: Javeria, Kamran, Jameel.

This is our semester project, we developed a model to classify the people in hospital into the out care ward or in care ward based on their reports.
We made this project using the data set of the hospital patients in the indonasia.
we have also deployed the model using the flask on regression model.

Guidline to run this project on Webpage:

We have added the files, 
1) download those files. <br> 
2) create new folder <br> 
3) copy the downloaded files and paste them in new created folder. <br>
4) also now create a new folder inside the newly created folder and then name it "templates"
5) now paste the index.html file into the templates folder.

Now you can open the folder in pycharm and run all those folders.
